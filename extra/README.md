# Examples and other extra code

This subdirectory contains a number of examples, showing how to accomplish common sequence alignment tasks using the PRALINE 2 toolkit. Some examples are implemented as standalone scripts, others come in [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebook form.

All scripts and notebooks require PRALINE 2 to be installed. See the README.md file in the root of this repository for instructions on how to install PRALINE 2. Although the code should be trivial to port to Python 2.x, the examples have only been tested on Python 3.6.
