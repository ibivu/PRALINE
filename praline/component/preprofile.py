    """Master-slave aligners build an approximate multiple sequence alignment
    by iteratively growing an alignment of a master sequence with a set

    aligned positions which correspond to a gap in the master sequence are
    removed, leaving only gaps in the slave sequence as a possibility. The 
    dummy master-slave aligner doesn't actually perform any alignments, it
    just returns an alignment in which the the master sequence is aligned
    to itself, yielding a profile containing just the master sequence. This
    is used in the commandline tool for its ClustalW-like (preprofile-less) 
    strategy.

    * master_sequence - the master sequence to build the dummy alignment
